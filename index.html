<p style="color:white";>Kim Dokja found himself within the story of his favorite novel, titled "Ways to Survive".</p>
<p style="color:white";>When he tried to off himself, he searched ways to survive and now relies on this novel to survive.</p>
<p style="color:white";>That being said he never missed a chance to sacrifice himself for his companions.</p>
<p style="color:white";>As a child, Kim Dokja loved to read, a habit that was encouraged by his mother.</p>
<p style="color:white";>Later on, Kim Dokja would go on to become the sole reader of all 3,149 chapters of the webnovel "Ways of Survival." </p>

<p style="color:white";>The characters in the novel would become sources of comfort for Kim Dokja as he struggled through his unfortunate life, <br> and he would grow alongside Yoo Joonghyuk as the protagonist regressed and struggled towards the end. </p>
<p style="color:white";> Kim Dokja undergoes various unfortunate events, including failing his CSAT and ending up at a third-rate university,<br> drawing an unlucky straw and ending up at the front lines during his military service, and landing a low-paying job at Minosoft. </p>
<p style="color:white";>Through it all he constantly reads the daily updates of the webnovel, consistently commenting under each chapter and <br> supporting the author while adding his own suggestions.</p>

<p style="color:white";>At one point he discovers "SSSSS-grade Infinite Regressor," a novel written by the original younger Han Sooyoung.<br> He comments angrily that it is clearly plagiarized and is shot down for trying to promote the ridiculously unpopular original "Ways of Survival." </p>
<p style="color:white";>When he approaches tls123 about this, the author only writes that they are glad they are getting more views, <br> which Kim Dokja finds pitiful.</p>

<p style="color:white";>Eventually, as he finishes the final chapter of "Ways of Survival" on the transit one day after work, the novel becomes reality,<br> beginning the events of Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.</p>
